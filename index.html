          <p> Through the next few web pages you will be asked to name
          the item that is in the picture. Every time you get the answer right
          you will be awarded a point and the total amount of points you
          have by the end of the quiz will determine your grade. Be sure
          to input your answer as a singular item and
          <b> NOT PLURAL </b>. You will be awarded zero points even if the
          answer is technically correct. Click the button below when you are ready
          to begin!
